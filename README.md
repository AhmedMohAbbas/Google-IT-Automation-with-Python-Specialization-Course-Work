# This Repository
This repository contains my own personal coursework throughout the whole Specialization. Keep in mind, the order of the courses may change in time. So it is better to actually check the files and not just rely on the numbering/naming of the directories. Each test that had some part of the code already provided beforehand by the examiner has commentary that clarifies that. Naturally, There will be some code snippets carried over here and there. As well as some personal notes and sketches, feel free to ignore those :)

Some files may contain code from examples as well as some trial and error and are not 100% my own code (examples, obviously) but could be useful to look at for a new learner. However, Any “Assignment” code is my own personally written code which I used to pass the course tests. At the Time of me taking this course, Python version 3.8 was being used in the course material and in the course tests. Feel free to use/check any of this code as you wish.
